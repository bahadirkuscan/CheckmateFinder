# CheckmateFinder

This program takes 2 text files as input: (File names are taken as input in the console)
1) Positions of all the pieces on the initial board and our color
2) All the possible opponent moves (forced moves) after our each move leading to checkmate

Console output is all of our moves leading to checkmate step by step.
